# mental-health-indicator-app
This is an app that will ingest user input data from the fitbit api and then use an anomaly detection algorithm. If the app detects anomalies, then it will message the user to check to see if everything is okay. It will further ask if they would like the app to help to schedule a meeting with their mental health counselor and/or share their health data.
