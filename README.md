# mental-health-indicator-app
This is an app that will ingest user input data from the fitbit api and then use an anomaly detection algorithm. If the app detects anomalies, then it will message the user and check to see if everything is okay and ask if they should schedule a meeting with their mental health counselor and/or share their data.
